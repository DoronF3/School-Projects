# Assignment 2: Advanced SQL 

**This assignment is to be done by yourself, but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with others.**

## Setup 
You can use the same setup as for Assignment 1 for this assignment. The only additional thing we will use here is Java, which was already installed.

## SQL Advanced Constructs (0.5 each -- total 4 points)
Here we use some of the more advanced constructs that are available in SQL, including ranking, functions, procedures, partitioning, triggers, 
and recursion. Not all of these will be covered in depth in class, and you are expected to read the PostgreSQL manual to understand how some of 
these constructs should be used. We have provided links to the appropriate PostgreSQL documentation and/or examples.

See `queries.py` for the details.

### Submission
Submit the queries.py file on Gradescope under Assignment 2.
