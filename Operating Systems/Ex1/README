Q1:
The programm recievs an argument from the user and a writes the given argument to the given file.
Followed by creating a directory named "Welcome", inside it creates another directory named "To",
after which it opens a file in the "To" directory named "OS2020" to which she writes:
"liron.menda
If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
lir"
liron.menda is the user name of the user running the program, and lir is the argument given.
After doing that the program closes the file and deletes it, followed by removeing both directories
first removing "To" and then "Welcome", and then the program finishes its work.
