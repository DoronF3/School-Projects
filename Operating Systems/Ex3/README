FILES:

README - This file.

MAKEFILE - The file to run the project.

MapReduceFramework.cpp - The file that runs the client and does the entire proccess.

Barrier.h - The library of the barrier.

Barrier.cpp - The implementation of the library.

fileWordCounter comparison - The picture of the time it takes to run the FileWordCounter given a different thread amount. 
The hardware used to do the measurmnets are: cpu 4, i5-6600.
We have seen that adding several threads reduces the amount of time taken to do the job, but at a certain point adding more threads 
almost doesnt change the time.

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Q1: The optimal number of kernal level threads for foo is the number of cores we have.
The reason for this being how expensive it is to switch between kernel level threads,
and they dont neew to be synchronized.

Q2.1: The number of lines that will be printed is n^2.

Q2.2: The number of options we have for the order of the printed lines is (n!)^2.
