fileWordCounter comparison - The picture of the time it takes to run the FileWordCounter given a different thread amount. 
The hardware used to do the measurmnets are: cpu 4, i5-6600.
We have seen that adding several threads reduces the amount of time taken to do the job, but at a certain point adding more threads 
almost doesnt change the time.
