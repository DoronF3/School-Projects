### Operating Systems Exercises

This directory contains a collection of exercises related to Operating Systems course projects. Each exercise focuses on different concepts and challenges in the field of operating systems.

- **[Memory Allocation Strategies](Operating%20Systems/Ex1)**

- **[Multithreading and Synchronization](Operating%20Systems/Ex2)** 

- **[Parallel Processing and MapReduce](Operating%20Systems/Ex3)** 

- **[Virtual Memory Management](Operating%20Systems/Ex4)** 

- **[README](Operating%20Systems/README.md)**: Details about each excersie

![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `C++`

### VLVector

This directory contains a custom implementation of a generic VLA Vector with functionality similar to std::Vector. The implementation utilizes both the stack and heap to store values, resulting in improved runtimes compared to std::Vector.

- **[VLVector](VLVector)**: A C++ template class that implements a variable-length array (VLA) vector. It provides similar functionality to `std::vector` and can dynamically switch between static and dynamic storage to optimize performance
  
- **[README](VLVector/README.md)**: Details about the vector capabilities and how to use
