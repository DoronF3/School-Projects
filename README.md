### Operating Systems Exercises

This directory contains a collection of exercises related to Operating Systems course projects. Each exercise focuses on different concepts and challenges in the field of operating systems.

- **[Memory Allocation Strategies](Operating%20Systems/Ex1)**: In this project, we explore various strategies for memory allocation in computer systems. We delve into techniques like contiguous memory allocation, paging, and segmentation.

- **[Multithreading and Synchronization](Operating%20Systems/Ex2)**: This project delves into multithreading and synchronization in concurrent programming. We address challenges like race conditions and deadlocks, implementing synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and monitors.

- **[Parallel Processing and MapReduce](Operating%20Systems/Ex3)**: This project is centered around parallel processing techniques and the MapReduce programming model. We design and implement parallel algorithms to tackle complex computational problems efficiently across multiple processors or cores.

- **[Virtual Memory Management](Operating%20Systems/Ex4)**: This project dives into the realm of virtual memory management within modern operating systems. Our project covers address translation, page replacement policies, and memory hierarchy.

- **[README](Operating%20Systems/README.md)**: Details about each excersie

### VLVector

This directory contains a custom implementation of a generic VLA Vector with functionality similar to std::Vector. The implementation utilizes both the stack and heap to store values, resulting in improved runtimes compared to std::Vector.

- **[VLVector](VLVector)**: A C++ template class that implements a variable-length array (VLA) vector. It provides similar functionality to `std::vector` and can dynamically switch between static and dynamic storage to optimize performance
  
- **[README](VLVector/README.md)**: Details about the vector capabilities and how to use
