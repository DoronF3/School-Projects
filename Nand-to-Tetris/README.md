# Computer Science Projects

Welcome to the collection of computer science projects! Each project explores different aspects of computer science, from hardware design to software implementation. Below is an overview of each project, its description, and the most important files with brief explanations.

## Project 1: Logic Gates and Memory

**Description:** Building logic gates and memory units using hardware description language (HDL).

**Key Files:**
- `And.hdl`: Implements the logic gate AND.
- `Or.hdl`: Implements the OR gate.
- `Not.hdl`: Implements the NOT gate.
- `And16.hdl`: Implements the 16-bit version of the AND gate.
- `Mux.hdl`: Implements a multiplexer.
- `Mux16.hdl`: Implements the 16-bit version of the multiplexer.

## Project 2: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

**Description:** Designing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs various arithmetic and logic operations.

**Key Files:**
- `ALU.hdl`: Implements the ALU with different arithmetic and logic operations.
- `Add16.hdl`: Implements a 16-bit adder.
- `Mul.hdl`: Implements a basic multiplier.

## Project 3: Memory Units

**Description:** Creating different memory units and hierarchical memory systems.

**Key Files:**
- `Bit.hdl`: Implements a single-bit memory cell.
- `RAM8.hdl`: Implements an 8-bit RAM.
- `RAM64.hdl`: Implements a 64-bit RAM.

## Project 4: Assembler

**Description:** Building an assembler for converting assembly code into machine code.

**Key Files:**
- `Assembler`: Assembler executable.
- `Code.py`: Python script for assembling code.
- `Parser.py`: Parses assembly commands.
