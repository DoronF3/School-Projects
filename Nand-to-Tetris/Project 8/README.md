# VM Translator and Tools

Welcome to the VM Translator and Tools directory. This collection of files includes scripts and tools designed to assist with translating VM code to assembly language and executing VM programs.

## Contents

- `CodeWriter.py`: A Python script that translates VM code into assembly code for a target architecture.
- `Main.py`: The main Python script for running the VM translator and related tasks.
- `Makefile`: A makefile for automating compilation and other build tasks.
- `Parser.py`: A Python script that parses and analyzes VM code, extracting important information.
- `README`: This README file providing an overview of the directory and its contents.
- `VMtranslator`: The executable binary for the VM translator.

## Usage

These files provide tools and scripts to facilitate VM programming and translation tasks. Here's a brief overview:

- `CodeWriter.py`: Translates VM code into assembly code for a specific target architecture.
- `Main.py`: The main script for running the VM translator and associated tasks.
- `Makefile`: Use this makefile to automate compilation, linking, and other build processes.
- `Parser.py`: A script for parsing and analyzing VM code, extracting relevant details.
- `VMtranslator`: The executable binary that performs the VM translation.
