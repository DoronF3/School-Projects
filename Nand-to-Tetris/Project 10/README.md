# Jack Compiler Part I

Welcome to the Jack Compiler and Tools directory. This collection of files includes scripts and tools designed to assist with compiling Jack programming language source code to virtual machine (VM) code.

## Contents

- `CompilationEngine.py`: A Python script that compiles Jack code to VM code using the Jack grammar rules.
- `Helper.py`: A Python script containing helper functions and utilities for the compilation process.
- `JackAnalyzer`: The main script for running the Jack compiler and associated tasks.
- `JackTokenizer.py`: A Python script that tokenizes Jack source code, breaking it into meaningful tokens.
- `Makefile`: A makefile for automating compilation, linking, and other build tasks.
- `README`: This README file providing an overview of the directory and its contents.

## Usage

These files provide tools and scripts to facilitate Jack programming and compilation tasks. Here's a brief overview:

- `CompilationEngine.py`: Compiles Jack source code to VM code by following the Jack grammar rules.
- `Helper.py`: Contains utility functions to assist in the compilation process.
- `JackAnalyzer`: The main script for running the Jack compiler and related tasks.
- `JackTokenizer.py`: Tokenizes Jack source code into meaningful tokens for compilation.
- `Makefile`: Use this makefile to automate compilation, linking, and other build processes.

## Getting Started

1. Study the purpose and functionality of each file in this directory to understand their roles in the compilation process.
2. Customize the scripts and tools as needed to fit your Jack programming and compilation tasks.
3. Use the provided scripts to compile Jack source code into VM code for the target architecture.
4. Refer to the `Makefile` for instructions on automating the compilation and build process.
5. Explore the provided `README` files for individual scripts/tools to learn more about their usage.

## Notes
