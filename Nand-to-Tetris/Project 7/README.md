# Virtual Machine Translator and Scripts

Welcome to the directory containing virtual machine (VM) translator scripts and tools. This collection of files is designed to assist with translating VM code into assembly language and executing VM programs.

## Contents

- `CodeWriter.py`: A Python script for translating VM code into assembly code.
- `Main.py`: The main Python script for executing the VM translator and related tasks.
- `Makefile`: A makefile for automating compilation and other tasks.
- `Parser.py`: A Python script for parsing and analyzing VM code.
- `README`: This README file providing an overview of the directory and its contents.
- `VMtranslator`: The executable binary for the VM translator.

## Usage

These files provide tools and scripts to facilitate VM programming and translation tasks. Here's a brief overview:

- `CodeWriter.py`: Translates VM code into assembly code for a target architecture.
- `Main.py`: The main script for running the VM translator and related tasks.
- `Makefile`: Use this makefile to automate compilation, linking, and other build tasks.
- `Parser.py`: A script for parsing and analyzing VM code, extracting important information.
- `VMtranslator`: The executable binary that performs VM translation.

## Getting Started

1. Review and understand the purpose and functionality of each file in this directory.
2. Modify and customize the scripts and tools as needed for your specific VM programming tasks.
3. Use the provided scripts to translate VM code to assembly code for your target architecture.
4. Refer to the `Makefile` to understand how to automate compilation and other build processes.
5. Check out the sample `README` files for each script/tool for more detailed usage instructions.

## Notes
