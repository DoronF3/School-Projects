# HDL Logic Gates and Multiplexers

This directory contains Hardware Description Language (HDL) files for various logic gates and multiplexers used in digital circuit design. Each HDL file represents a specific gate or multiplexer functionality.

## Contents

- `And.hdl`: Represents a basic AND gate.
- `And16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit AND gate.
- `DMux.hdl`: Represents a Demultiplexer.
- `DMux4Way.hdl`: Represents a 4-way Demultiplexer.
- `DMux8Way.hdl`: Represents an 8-way Demultiplexer.
- `Mux.hdl`: Represents a Multiplexer.
- `Mux16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit Multiplexer.
- `Mux4Way16.hdl`: Represents a 4-way 16-bit Multiplexer.
- `Mux8Way16.hdl`: Represents an 8-way 16-bit Multiplexer.
- `Not.hdl`: Represents a NOT gate.
- `Not16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit NOT gate.
- `Or.hdl`: Represents an OR gate.
- `Or16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit OR gate.
- `Or8Way.hdl`: Represents an 8-way OR gate.
- `Xor.hdl`: Represents an XOR gate.

## Usage

Each HDL file in this directory represents a specific logic gate or multiplexer. You can use these files to build more complex digital circuits by combining these basic building blocks. To use these files:

1. Choose the appropriate HDL file for the logic gate or multiplexer you want to use.
2. Open the chosen HDL file in a HDL simulator or hardware description tool.
3. Follow the HDL syntax and design principles to integrate the chosen gate/multiplexer into your larger circuit design.
4. Simulate and test your circuit using the HDL simulator or tool.

## Notes

- HDL files use a hardware description language to represent digital logic components and their interconnections.
- These HDL files are provided as educational examples and can be used to learn about digital circuit design principles.

Feel free to use, modify, and integrate these HDL files into your own digital circuit designs.
