# Jack OS Standard Library

Welcome to the Jack Standard Library directory. This collection of files includes the standard Jack library modules that provide useful abstractions for common programming tasks.

## Contents

- `Array.jack`: A module that provides array manipulation and utilities.
- `Keyboard.jack`: A module that offers keyboard input functionality.
- `Math.jack`: A module containing mathematical operations and functions.
- `Memory.jack`: A module that manages memory segments and allocation.
- `Output.jack`: A module for output and printing functions.
- `README`: This README file providing an overview of the directory and its contents.
- `Screen.jack`: A module for screen output and graphics functions.
- `String.jack`: A module for string manipulation and utilities.
- `Sys.jack`: A module that interfaces with the system for I/O operations.

## Usage

These standard library modules provide pre-defined functions and abstractions to assist with common programming tasks in the Jack language. Here's a brief overview:

- `Array.jack`: Provides utilities for working with arrays, such as initialization and indexing.
- `Keyboard.jack`: Offers methods to read keyboard input and store it in variables.
- `Math.jack`: Contains mathematical operations and utility functions.
- `Memory.jack`: Manages memory segments and provides memory allocation capabilities.
- `Output.jack`: Provides functions for output and printing.
- `Screen.jack`: Offers screen output and basic graphics functions.
- `String.jack`: Contains string manipulation functions and utilities.
- `Sys.jack`: Interfaces with the system for I/O operations.

## Getting Started

1. Study the purpose and functionality of each standard library module to understand its role in simplifying common programming tasks.
2. Use the provided modules in your Jack programs to leverage pre-defined functions and abstractions.
3. Modify and extend the modules as needed to suit your specific programming requirements.
4. Refer to the `README` files within each module to learn more about their usage and available functions.

## Notes

- These standard library modules are designed to facilitate programming in the Jack language and simplify common
