# HDL Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Arithmetic Components

Welcome to the directory containing Hardware Description Language (HDL) files for various arithmetic and logic components used in digital circuit design. Each HDL file represents a specific arithmetic or logic operation.

## Contents

- `ALU.hdl`: Represents an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- `Add16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit Adder.
- `FullAdder.hdl`: Represents a Full Adder.
- `HalfAdder.hdl`: Represents a Half Adder.
- `Inc16.hdl`: Represents a 16-bit Incrementer.
- `Mul.hdl`: Represents a Multiplier.
- `ShiftLeft.hdl`: Represents a Left Shifter.
- `ShiftRight.hdl`: Represents a Right Shifter.

## Usage

These HDL files provide building blocks for implementing arithmetic and logic operations in digital circuits. To use these files:

1. Choose the appropriate HDL file for the component you want to use.
2. Open the chosen HDL file in a HDL simulator or hardware description tool.
3. Follow the HDL syntax and design principles to integrate the chosen component into your larger circuit design.
4. Simulate and test your circuit using the HDL simulator or tool.

## Notes

- HDL files use a hardware description language to represent digital logic components and their interconnections.
- These HDL files are provided as educational examples and can be used to learn about digital circuit design principles.
