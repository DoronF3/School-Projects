README - This file.

HalfAdder - Half Adder.

FullAdder - Full Adder.

Add16 - 16-bit Adder.

Inc16 - 16-bit incrementer.

ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit.

ShiftLeft - The chip will multiply by 2 its input and won't change their sign.

ShiftRight - The chip will divide by 2 its input, won't change their sign and take care of odd numbers.

Mul - The chip will multiply 2 numbers and handle overflows

Remarks
-------
* The chips were implemented by using NAND gates and the other chips. cool!
