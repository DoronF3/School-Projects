# Assembly Language Programs

Welcome to the directory containing Assembly Language (ASM) programs. Each ASM file represents a specific program or algorithm implemented in assembly language.

## Contents

- `Divide.asm`: Represents an assembly program that performs division.
- `Fill.asm`: Represents an assembly program that fills memory locations with specified values.
- `Mult.asm`: Represents an assembly program that performs multiplication.
- `Sort.asm`: Represents an assembly program that implements a sorting algorithm.

## Usage

These ASM files provide examples of assembly language programs for various tasks. To use these files:

1. Choose the appropriate ASM file for the program or algorithm you want to use.
2. Open the chosen ASM file in an assembly language development environment or assembler.
3. Review and understand the program's code and logic.
4. Assemble the program to generate the corresponding machine code.
5. Execute the assembled program on a suitable environment, emulator, or hardware platform.

## Notes

- Assembly language is a low-level programming language used to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
- These ASM files are provided as educational examples and can be used to learn about assembly language programming and algorithms.
