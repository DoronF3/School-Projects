# Hardware Description Language (HDL) Files

Welcome to the directory containing Hardware Description Language (HDL) files. Each HDL file represents a specific hardware component or system implemented using HDL.

## Contents

- `CPU.hdl`: Represents the implementation of a central processing unit (CPU).
- `Computer.hdl`: Represents the implementation of a computer system.
- `CpuMul.hdl`: Represents an extended CPU with multiplication capability.
- `ExtendAlu.hdl`: Represents an extended arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with additional operations.
- `Memory.hdl`: Represents the implementation of memory components.

## Usage

These HDL files provide examples of hardware components and systems implemented using HDL. To use these files:

1. Choose the appropriate HDL file for the hardware component or system you want to explore.
2. Open the chosen HDL file in an HDL development environment or simulator.
3. Review and understand the hardware design and logic described in the file.
4. Use the HDL development environment to simulate and verify the functionality of the hardware design.
5. Integrate the hardware component or system into larger designs or systems as needed.

## Notes

- Hardware Description Language (HDL) is used to describe and design digital circuits and systems at a low level.
- These HDL files are provided as educational examples and can be used to learn about hardware design and simulation.
