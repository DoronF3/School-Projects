# HDL Memory Components

Welcome to the directory containing Hardware Description Language (HDL) files for memory components used in digital circuit design. Each HDL file represents a specific memory unit or storage component.

## Contents

- `Bit.hdl`: Represents a single-bit memory unit.
- `PC.hdl`: Represents a Program Counter (PC).
- `RAM16K.hdl`: Represents a 16K RAM (Random Access Memory).
- `RAM4K.hdl`: Represents a 4K RAM (Random Access Memory).
- `RAM512.hdl`: Represents a 512-byte RAM (Random Access Memory).
- `RAM64.hdl`: Represents a 64-byte RAM (Random Access Memory).
- `RAM8.hdl`: Represents an 8-byte RAM (Random Access Memory).
- `Register.hdl`: Represents a register, a small unit of storage in a digital circuit.

## Usage

These HDL files provide building blocks for implementing memory and storage components in digital circuits. To use these files:

1. Choose the appropriate HDL file for the memory component you want to use.
2. Open the chosen HDL file in a HDL simulator or hardware description tool.
3. Follow the HDL syntax and design principles to integrate the chosen component into your larger circuit design.
4. Simulate and test your circuit using the HDL simulator or tool.

## Notes

- HDL files use a hardware description language to represent digital logic components and their interconnections.
- These HDL files are provided as educational examples and can be used to learn about digital circuit design principles.
