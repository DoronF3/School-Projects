# Data Science Final Project Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Final Project repository! This repository contains the files related to the final project of the Data Science course. The project focuses on understanding what impacts the number of peak concurrent users (CCU) of games and software on the Steam platform. Here's a brief overview of the files included:

- `Data Science Final Project.pptx`: This PowerPoint presentation file contains the slides used for the final project presentation. It summarizes the key findings, insights, methodologies, and results of the data analysis conducted as part of the project. The presentation provides a visual representation of the project's outcomes and is intended to be shared with stakeholders.

- `Data Science Final.docx`: This Word document file contains the detailed written report of the final project. It elaborates on the project's background, objectives, data sources, methodology, analysis techniques, results, and conclusions. The document provides a comprehensive narrative of the entire project, catering to readers who prefer a textual and structured format.

- `main.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file represents the main codebase for the final project. It contains the Python code, explanations, and visualizations that were used to perform data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and any other relevant tasks. The notebook is interactive and provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the data science workflow followed in the project. You can execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis or explore the code and visualizations interactively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository and access the project materials, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
git clone https://github.com/DoronF3/School-Projects/Data-Science/FInal-Project.git

2. **Access Project Files:** Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the repository's directory using the command line or a file explorer. You will find the three main project files mentioned above: `Data Science Final Project.pptx`, `Data Science Final.docx`, and `main.ipynb`.

3. **Review the Files:** You can review the PowerPoint presentation, Word document, and Jupyter Notebook to understand the project's content, findings, and codebase.

4. **Interact with the Notebook:** If you want to interact with the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the required Python environment set up. You will need libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and any other dependencies used in the project. You can install them using package managers like pip or conda.

5. **Modify and Extend:** Feel free to modify the code, add more analysis, or adapt the project for your own purposes. You can also use this repository as a template for organizing your own data science projects.
